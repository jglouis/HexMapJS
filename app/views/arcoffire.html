          <p>Spaceships in Hexode will have a large choice of weaponry.
          Each weapon has its own arc of fire, which appears in red on the map
          once at least one weapon is selected. Number on red tiles
          represent damage dealt to ennemies. Arc of fires from different
          weapons combines their strength and the numbers simply add up!</p>

          <p>If an ennemy ship is caught within a red hex, the corresponding
          number translates into damage. (The damage system is still a work in
          progress)</p>
