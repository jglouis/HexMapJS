          <p>The green hexes represent the allowed destinations for the spaceship.</p>

          <p>The black arow is called "movement vector". It represents the inertia
          of the spaceship. In space, an object tends to keep its velocity if
          no force is applied to it. I wanted to represent this idea in Hexode.
          The black arrow points to the default destination if no move order is given
          to the ship this turn.</p>

          <p>Movement is restricted by two factors, beside the movement vector.</p>
          <li>ship's manoeuvrability</li>
          <li>ship's max movement speed</li>
          <br>
          <p>To know if a hexagon is reachable (green), the hexagon must satisfies two
          conditions:</p>
          <li>distance between the destination and the top of the movement
          vector must be less or equal than ship's manoeuvrability</li>
          <li>distance between the ship's current position and the base of the
          movement vector must be less or equal than ship's max movement speed</li>
          <br>
          <p>Next turn, once the ship has moved to its destination, the
          movement vector is updated according to its new trajectory. Click
          on a green location to see the new ship position, its new orientation
          and the updated movement vector.</p>
          <p>Try to change manoeuvrability and max speed (they are both capped to
          3, as it is a hard limit for these characteristics) and to drag and
          drop the tip of the movement vector to get a sense of the movement
          system.</p>
          <p>Ships going fast will be limited by their manoeuvrability, and
          vice versa. In some extreme cases (try with a big enough movement
          vector or low characteristics), you may notice than there are no valid
          destinations. I plan to have this situation happening in the game. It
          will represent a ship out of control.</p>
