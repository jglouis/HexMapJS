  <h1>What is this website about?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to HexMapJS, this website is part of the Hexode project. See About page for all the links.</p>

    <p>HexMapJS is a subproject of Hexode. It serves two purposes:</p>
    <li>Build a generalist and minimalistic tool for handling hexagonal board
      games in JavaScript. This is what hexmap.js is for.</li>
    <li>Provide tools for testing and showcasing gameplay ideas. Hexagonal boards
       are hard to draw by hand. So it will be a great convenience for me as an
       extension of my blog.</li>
    <br>
    <p>This subsite will evolve and its content will be updated as work goes on
    on the main project.<p>
       <br>
    The dev.
